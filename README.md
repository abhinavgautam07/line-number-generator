# line-number-generator
 
 **Version 1.0.0**

 A lot of programmers and developers use 'printing to console' for debugging the code rather than using a debugger. On client Side debugging browser provides the line and the file from which a perticular thing is printed, but does not specify the folder, so if file with same name occurs in different folders, it might get confusing from where this is getting printed. On command Line for server side debugging neither file name nor line number is specified. So What my extension does is, upon single command, it generates [folder_name | file_name...line_number] in this format to save time and typing.
